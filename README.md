# Malicious File Detection + Email Alert System Using Wazuh and VirusTotal

## Introduction
This project demonstrates endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities using Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring platform. The objective is to monitor critical directories for malicious or suspicious files, integrate VirusTotal to automatically check file hashes for threats, and send email alerts when a potentially malicious file is detected. For this project, Ubuntu virtual machines were used for both the Wazuh Manager and Agent.
